# Inviting new people to participate in Panga 

As an open network, anyone in Panga can support new people to participate by following a transparent invitation process. 

When you would like to invite additional people to join us in any of aspect of Panga we expect you to do so thoughtfully; when you have the capacity to support the newly joined participant in learning the [shared context](content/orientation.md) Panga cultivates and to take responsibility for co-creating this network of interdependent relationships through which we can experiments with multiple overlapping collectivists practices. 

## Invitation Principles

The following are an initial set of Principles we hope will help guide us all in being thoughtful about when, how, and why we invite more people to participate in co-creating our network of collectivists experiments.
  * Trust & Respect
  * Building on shared foundations
  * Interdependent responsibility

These Principles are intended to reflect our 'growth at the speed of trust' goals. Together, these principles inform our invitation expectations that an existing participant can explain to another existing participant why they *trust* the potential participant to engage *respectfully* with other participants; the potential participant's interest in *building on shared foundations* to explore potential approaches to co-creating better futures by collectivising our basic needs; and the degree to which the existing participant is willing to take *responsibility* for supporting each new potential participant in navigating the *interdependent* relationships that may emerge through their participation in Panga. 

## Invitation Preparation 

To help in considering the relevance of these invitation principles in specific situations, please consider how you would explain to an existing participant why it is a good idea to invite this potential participant to join //now//. For example, consider how you would finish the following statements: 
  * Interest: The aspects of Panga that are most likely to be of interest to [Name] are.... 
  * Alignment: The Panga values and theories of change I think are most likely to resonate with [Name] are....
  * Context: The existing context [Name] has for the shared foundation we are currently building-on within Panga include...  
  * Capacity: [Name's] current capacity to contribute to Panga is likely to be.... 
  * Conflict navigation: If conflict arise between [Name] and other Panga participants, I am able to support them to navigate that in the following ways... (And, if [Name] and I need to navigate a conflict we are prepared to.... )

## Invitation Process

  * Once you have considered the Invitation Principles and are confident about inviting a potential participant to the Campfire, please reach out to another existing participant to explain why this is a good time to invite this person into these conversations:
  * If this second existing participant supports the invitation, they can post an invitation request in the appropriate Campfire thread explaining why this is a good time to invite this person into these conversations
  * This post will trigger an email to be sent to the potential participant with a link to the Yam Daisy invitation process (offering some context about Panga, and a personalised invitation from you to attend an upcoming [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md))
