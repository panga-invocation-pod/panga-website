## Panga Context
Collectivist experiments have highlighted the value of cultivating decentralised networks large enough to support multiple self-governing groups yet small enough that everyone is connected to everyone else, either directly or via someone they trust. Complementing the continued flourishing of existing networks, Panga is a project seeking to combine networked relationships with small-group self-governance to cultivate multiple *place-based* experiments in collectively meeting our *basic needs*. 

The initial iteration of the Panga vision emerged from an Invocation Pod -- an exploration of the possibility that we might invoke a network of people practising various configurations of experimental approaches to collectivising basic needs in our local areas. Building on this, we began collaborating on ways to amplify and develop technical and conceptual tools that reduce the barriers to forming multiple overlapping forms of collective practices. 

In invoking a Panga network, we are seeking collaborators who are willing to join us in taking responsibility for creating and maintaining the supportive and respectful culture we are hoping to cultivate through this vision of Panga. At the same time, we want this network to grow at the speed of trust; to remain open to new participants while still functioning as a supportive space to gather and explore different approaches to collectivising basic needs. 

As part of the invocation process, we created a [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md) to outline the current set of foundational values, concepts, and practices that our vision of Panga builds upon. 

With this shared foundation, we hope to develop various Panga processes and tools that will help us all to self-organise into multiple overlapping small-groups who can practice collectivising basic needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety. 


## Panga Values
The values we hope to embody through Panga's approach to cultivating more collective practices are: 

  * Pluralistic experimentation
  * Prefigurative politics 
  * Grounded practice
  * Interdependent relationships

These values reflect our theories of change: 

  * Resilience through Collectivism: we believe that multiple pluralistic collectives managing those local resources that relate to real life needs (shelter, food, transport, energy, etc) can lead to greater local resilience. In the coming years and decades, local resilience will have real, on-the-ground benefits to people’s lives as we deal with the increasing effects of climate change.

  * Prefigurative Politics: while the term may not be widely used outside of certain activist circles, prefigurative politics is fundamental to the goals of Panga. Briefly, the idea is that we focus on political change through ‘the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now’ (Boggs, 1977). The Commons Library article [Prefigurative Politics in Practice](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) outlines how prefigurative politics fosters plurality and offers an important grounded change-making practices that can support other forms of activism such as efforts that focus on resisting and/or reforming existing systems.

  * Think globally, act locally: Panga concentrates on a particular local area. The idea is that supporting an increase in the number of experimental ways of living more collectively in a particular area will have a noticeable impact on the Overton Window locally. We believe that the broader ripple effects of the local acts will amplify, and be amplified by, complementary local practices across the globe.

## Participating in Panga
For those who choose to become collaborators in future iterations of the Panga vision, we have seeded several participation avenues as a starting point:

  * Recharging with cozy hopepunk conversations at the [Panga Campfire](/campfire/) and amplifying global examples of collective practices that we can learn from in our local contexts.
  * Nourishing our interdependent relationships, including by attending and hosting [Panga Gatherings](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_gatherings.md) and participating in [Panga Pods](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_pods.md) to explore the potential of specific collectivist experiments.
  * Adapting Panga tools and processes to experiment with longer-term efforts to collectivise specific sets of basic needs - see [Panga resources]() 
  * Contributing to those collectives stewarding the Panga vision and infrastructure - see [Panga Collectives](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_collectives.md)

### Inviting new people to participate in Panga 

As an open network, anyone in Panga can support new people to participate by following a transparent invitation process. 

When you would like to invite additional people to join us in any of aspect of Panga we expect you to do so thoughtfully; when you have the capacity to support the newly joined participant in learning the shared context Panga cultivates and to take responsibility for co-creating this network of interdependent relationships through which we can experiments with multiple overlapping collectivists practices. 

#### Invitation Principles

The following are an initial set of Principles we hope will help guide us all in being thoughtful about when, how, and why we invite more people to participate in co-creating our network of collectivists experiments.
  * Trust & Respect
  * Building on shared foundations
  * Interdependent responsibility

These Principles are intended to reflect our 'growth at the speed of trust' goals. Together, these principles inform our invitation expectations that an existing participant can explain to another existing participant why they *trust* the potential participant to engage *respectfully* with other participants; the potential participant's interest in *building on shared foundations* to explore potential approaches to co-creating better futures by collectivising our basic needs; and the degree to which the existing participant is willing to take *responsibility* for supporting each new potential participant in navigating the *interdependent* relationships that may emerge through their participation in Panga. 

#### Invitation Preparation 

To help in considering the relevance of these invitation principles in specific situations, please consider how you would explain to an existing participant why it is a good idea to invite this potential participant to join //now//. For example, consider how you would finish the following statements: 
  * Interest: The aspects of Panga that are most likely to be of interest to [Name] are.... 
  * Alignment: The Panga values and theories of change I think are most likely to resonate with [Name] are....
  * Context: The existing context [Name] has for the shared foundation we are currently building-on within Panga include...  
  * Capacity: [Name's] current capacity to contribute to Panga is likely to be.... 
  * Conflict navigation: If conflict arise between [Name] and other Panga participants, I am able to support them to navigate that in the following ways... (And, if [Name] and I need to navigate a conflict we are prepared to.... )

#### Invitation Process

  * Once you have considered the Invitation Principles and are confident about inviting a potential participant to the Campfire, please reach out to another existing participant to explain why this is a good time to invite this person into these conversations:
  * If this second existing participant supports the invitation, they can post an invitation request in the appropriate Campfire thread explaining why this is a good time to invite this person into these conversations
  * This post will trigger an email to be sent to the potential participant with a link to the Yam Daisy invitation process (offering some context about Panga, and a personalised invitation from you to attend an upcoming [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md))
