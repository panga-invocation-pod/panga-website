## Panga Context
The initial iteration of the Panga vision emerged from an Invocation Pod -- an exploration of how to support participants in small self-governing groups to experiment with multiple approaches to collectively meeting their basic needs. Building on this vision, we began collaborating on ways to amplify and develop technical and conceptual tools that reduce the barriers to forming multiple overlapping forms of collective practices.

As part of this project we hope to cultivate supportive spaces to gather and explore different approaches that grows at the speed of trust; we want Panga to remain open to new participants while still functioning as a focal point we can gather around to explore different approaches to collectivising basic needs. We are therefore seeking collaborators who are willing to join us in taking responsibility for creating and maintaining the respectful, interdependent relationships from which sustainable collective practices can emerge.

As part of the invocation process, we created a [Panga Context-Setting Workshop]() to outline the current set of foundational values, concepts, and practices that our vision of Panga builds upon. 

With this shared foundation, we hope to develop various Panga processes and tools that will help us all to self-organise into multiple overlapping small-groups who can practice collectivising basic needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety.

## Panga Values
The values we hope to embody through Panga's approach to cultivating more collective practices are: 

  * Grounded
  * Interdependent
  * Pluralistic
  * Prefigurative

These values reflect our theories of change: 

  * Resilience through Collectivism: in the coming years and decades, local resilience will have real, on-the-ground benefits to people’s lives as we deal with the increasing effects of climate change. We believe that if we can experiment with multiple pluralistic collectives to manage basic resources this may contribute to greater local resilience by providing opportunities to practice the relational skills that will help us adapt to climate-change driven disruptions to the current supply of basic needs (such as food, energy, and shelter) via private and/or public systems. Our interest in this theory of change reflects our values of remaining **grounded** in our local contexts and of cultivating resilience skills such as the web of **interdependent** trust-based relationships that have been repeatedly shown to underpin the sustainability of collective practices

  * Think globally, act locally: if we support an increase in the number of experimental ways of living more collectively in a particular area will have a noticeable impact on the Overton Window by modelling alternatives to the status quo and amplifying, and being amplified by, collective practices across the globe. These beliefs reflects our appreciation that the local and global are **interdependent** and our value for remaining **grounded** by our ability to impact our local conditions,  while cultivating a **pluralistic** appreciation for alternative strategies emerging within different conditions 

  * Prefiguring Better Futures: if we experiment with collectively meeting the basic needs within our local areas, we can  explore multiple here-and-now implementations of our desired potential futures by supporting each other to explore diverse approaches to collectively governing commmon resources. This notion draws on the concept of 'Prefigurative Politics' - actions that contribute to political change through ‘the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now’ (Boggs, 1977). While the term 'prefigurative politics' emerged from a particular set of activist and academic contexts, the Commons Library article [Prefigurative Politics in Practice](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) outlines how this concept has long been an important features of grassroots organising. This theory of change reflects our value in cultivating **pluralistic** visions of what potential better futures could be, and the value we place on the potential for **prefigurative** practices to contribute, along with other forms of activism, to us collectively reaching towards ever better yet-to-be-determined futures.

## Participating in Panga
Panga is a project with multiple avenues for participation, from full participation of contributing to the decision-making process of stewarding future iterations of Panga, all the way to intermittent participation in 'campfire' conversations. 

So far, this includes: 

  * Recharging with cozy hopepunk conversations at the [Panga Campfire](/campfire/) and amplifying global examples of collective practices that we can learn from in our local contexts.
  * Nourishing our interdependent relationships, including by attending and hosting [Panga Gatherings](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_gatherings.md) and participating in [Panga Pods](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_pods.md) to explore the potential areas for experimenting with collectivising specific sets of basic needs.
  * Adapting Panga tools and processes to experiment with longer-term efforts to collectivise specific sets of basic needs - see [Panga resources]() 
  * Contributing to the collectives stewarding the Panga vision and making decisions about when and how to prioritise new infrastructure - see [Panga Collectives](/panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_collectives.md)
  * Support new people to participate by following a transparent [invitation process](/invitations.md).
