## Panga Context
Collectivist experiments have highlighted the value of cultivating decentralised networks large enough to support multiple self-governing groups yet small enough that everyone is connected to everyone else, either directly or via someone they trust. Complementing the continued flourishing of existing networks, Panga is a project seeking to combine networked relationships with small-group self-governance to cultivate multiple *place-based* experiments in collectively meeting our *basic needs*. 

The initial iteration of the Panga vision emerged from an Invocation Pod -- an exploration of the possibility that we might invoke a network of people practising various configurations of experimental approaches to collectivising basic needs in our local areas. Building on this, we began collaborating on ways to amplify and develop technical and conceptual tools that reduce the barriers to forming multiple overlapping forms of collective practices. 

In invoking a Panga network, we are seeking collaborators who are willing to join us in taking responsibility for creating and maintaining the supportive and respectful culture we are hoping to cultivate through this vision of Panga. At the same time, we want this network to grow at the speed of trust; to remain open to new participants while still functioning as a supportive space to gather and explore different approaches to collectivising basic needs. 

As part of the invocation process, we created a [Panga Context-Setting Workshop](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_workshop_intro.md) to outline the current set of foundational values, concepts, and practices that our vision of Panga builds upon. 

With this shared foundation, we hope to develop various Panga processes and tools that will help us all to self-organise into multiple overlapping small-groups who can practice collectivising basic needs such as food, care, shelter, energy, transport, and safety. 

## Panga Values
The values we hope to embody through Panga's approach to cultivating more collective practices are: 

  * Pluralistic experimentation
  * Prefigurative politics 
  * Grounded practice
  * Interdependent relationships

These values reflect our theories of change: 

  * Resilience through Collectivism: we believe that multiple pluralistic collectives managing those local resources that relate to real life needs (shelter, food, transport, energy, etc) can lead to greater local resilience. In the coming years and decades, local resilience will have real, on-the-ground benefits to people’s lives as we deal with the increasing effects of climate change.

  * Prefigurative Politics: while the term may not be widely used outside of certain activist circles, prefigurative politics is fundamental to the goals of Panga. Briefly, the idea is that we focus on political change through ‘the deliberate experimental implementation of desired future social relations and practices in the here-and-now’ (Boggs, 1977). The Commons Library article [Prefigurative Politics in Practice](https://commonslibrary.org/prefigurative-politics-in-practice/) outlines how prefigurative politics fosters plurality and offers an important grounded change-making practices that can support other forms of activism such as efforts that focus on resisting and/or reforming existing systems.

  * Think globally, act locally: Panga concentrates on a particular local area. The idea is that supporting an increase in the number of experimental ways of living more collectively in a particular area will have a noticeable impact on the Overton Window locally. We believe that the broader ripple effects of the local acts will amplify, and be amplified by, complementary local practices across the globe.

## Participating in Panga
For those who choose to become collaborators in future iterations of the Panga vision, we have seeded several participation avenues as a starting point:

  * Recharging with cozy hopepunk conversations at the [Panga Campfire](/campfire/) and amplifying global examples of collective practices that we can learn from in our local contexts.
  * Nourishing our interdependent relationships, including by attending and hosting [Panga Gatherings](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_gatherings.md) and participating in [Panga Pods](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_pods.md) to explore the potential of specific collectivist experiments.
  * Adapting Panga tools and processes to experiment with longer-term efforts to collectivise specific sets of basic needs - see [Panga resources]() 
  * Contributing to those collectives stewarding the Panga vision and infrastructure - see [Panga Collectives](panga-concepts/participating_in_panga/panga_collectives.md)
  * Support new people to participate by following a transparent [invitation process](content/invitations.md).
